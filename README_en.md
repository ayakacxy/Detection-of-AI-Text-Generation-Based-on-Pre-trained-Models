# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect AI-generated text using pre-trained models. By leveraging various pre-trained models, we can effectively distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text.

## File Structure
- `Train And Test/`: Contains training and testing data.
- `tools/`: Contains auxiliary tools and scripts.
- `main.py`: Main script to execute text detection tasks.
- `README.md`: Project description file.

## Installation
Ensure you have a Python 3.x environment and install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script to perform detection:
```bash
python main.py --input your_text_file.txt
```
